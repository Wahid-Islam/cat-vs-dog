# Literature Survey

Problem Definitions and Learning Settings

The task of image classification, specifically cat vs. dog classification, falls under **supervised learning**, where input images are paired with labels. Key settings and challenges include:

| **Setting**                  | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Supervised  vs. Unsupervised | This project is supervised; labels are known. Unsupervised tasks such as clustering, lack  labeled data. |
| Closed-set vs. Open-set      | Closed-set: Only cats and dogs are expected. Open-set classification must handle unknown  classes. |
| Domain shift                 | This project assumes no domain shift. In real scenarios, domain adaptation methods may be  needed when train/test data distributions differ. |

### Recent Progress & Key Research Groups

Based on the previous research in the image processing area, The main trends and the key research group can be summarized in the following parts.

- Facebook AI (Meta) and Google Brain are leading in computer vision.
- EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Vision Transformers are modern architectures.
- Vision Transformers(ViT, 2020) outperform CNNs at scale, but require more data and compute.

Although we finally decide to make use of the ResNet to do our project,product whose name is Segment-anything[14] developed by the Meta which belongs to the Facebook AI research group has broaden the scope of knowledge in the computer vision. Just as shown in the figure below, Segment-anything makes use of a Vision Transformer to encode the image, which allows the system to break the image into different prompts such as points, boxes, and masks. Then the mask decoder will combine image embedding and the prompt embedding to generate the output which allows for the further use. As we can see in the figure that the dataset contains sufficient pictures, masks, and videos for the training process. The advantage of this model is that it trains the model to respond to prompts with precise masks which generalize the result to rely on the any object instead of on certain specific groups of objects. With its breakthrough in the generalization, Segment-anything with the traits depicted above can be used in the photo editing, robotics, and VR area.

## d)-h) Prediction results Analysis

### Correctly Classified Samples and strength analysis
【4】Example Correct Case：4
<img src="C:\Users\Siris\Desktop\datasets\test\4.jpg" alt="4" style="zoom:33%;" />
【162】Example Correct Case：162
<img src="C:\Users\Siris\Desktop\datasets\test\162.jpg" alt="162" style="zoom: 80%;" />

From Figure 4, it can be observed that the image exhibits high quality and clarity. The Golden Retriever displays well-defined morphological contours, with its coat coloration, textural patterns, facial features (including ear and snout outlines) providing spatially discriminative attributes typical of the canine category. These characteristics enable unambiguous classification into the "dog" class.

In Figure 162, the Chinese Li Hua cat demonstrates clear triangular ear contours and vibrissae around the nasal region. The mottled fur pigmentation pattern contributes strong spatial distinctiveness. When compared to dogs’ rounded ear margins and prominent snout structures, these contrasting morphological traits allow the model to confidently identify the image as belonging to the "cat" category.

This analysis demonstrates the model’s robust performance in recognizing standardized images. The ResNet18 architecture achieves high classification accuracy (typically exceeding baseline benchmarks) on well-lit, sharply captured cat/dog photographs, indicating its effective learning of species-defining features through hierarchical feature extraction. Notably, the model’s success stems from strategic transfer learning implementation: retaining pre-trained convolutional layers from ImageNet (preserving generalized feature extraction capabilities) while replacing the original fully connected layers. By fine-tuning only the terminal classification layers and freezing convolutional parameters, this approach mitigates overfitting risks inherent to small datasets. The adaptation of these pre-trained weights significantly enhances performance, as evidenced by the model’s superior classification accuracy in comparative evaluations.
### Identify Incorrectly Classified Samples and weakness analysis
【244】Example Incorrect Case：244（predicted=cat，actual class=dog）

<img src="C:\Users\Siris\Desktop\datasets\test\244.jpg" alt="244" style="zoom:50%;" />]

【245】Example Incorrect Case：245（predicted=cat，actual class=dog）
<img src="C:\Users\Siris\Desktop\datasets\test\245.jpg" alt="245" style="zoom:50%;" />

From Figure 244, it can be observed that the dog has overall dark and mixed fur colors (black, gray, white), lacks distinct dog ear shapes or nasal bridge contours, and exhibits relatively poorer image quality compared to other images in the training and validation sets, with a rough texture. These factors collectively led the model to misclassify the "curly, black, and blurry" pattern as a cat.

In Figure 245, most of the brown dog’s face is obscured by cage bars, with only half of its face visible. This may have hindered the model’s extraction of its facial and facial feature contours, resulting in insufficient visual information. Additionally, the cage bars cast black striped shadows on the dog’s face, creating mottled fur colors, which caused the model’s misjudgment.

From these observations, we can identify several weakness of the model in this project. The model demonstrates ​​poor handling of complex scenarios or partial occlusions​​—when targets are obscured by cages, fur, low-light conditions, or exhibit non-standard postures, it frequently fails to extract sufficient discriminative features, resulting in misclassification. Additionally, it exhibits ​​susceptibility to background and non-target interference​​, where cluttered environments (e.g., metal bars or newspaper textures) disrupt feature extraction, particularly when the network struggles to localize the primary subject accurately. A critical limitation stems from ​​training data constraints: the dataset predominantly relies on conventional images of real cats and dogs but lacks specialized structural or feature-contour representations of these animals. This overreliance on manual feature engineering [9] undermines the model’s generalization capacity. To address this, expanding the training set with structural/feature-contour annotations and validating performance on larger-scale data [8] would be advisable.

## Impact of Different Model Choices on Classification Accuracy
### Model Selection
In this project, our team adopted the ResNet18 model, an 18-layer deep convolutional neural network provided by PyTorch, which is widely employed in image classification tasks. Leveraging the residual architecture and skip connections inherent to the ResNet framework, this model effectively addresses the common gradient vanishing problem in deep network training while ensuring stability during optimization.
#### Comparison Within the ResNet Family
While the accuracy rankings on ImageNet are as follows: ResNet18 (69.6%) < ResNet50 (76.9%) < ResNet101 (77.1%)[10], deeper networks tend to overfit more easily on small datasets (e.g., <100,000 images). Empirical validation on our training dataset revealed that ResNet18 achieved the best performance (98% accuracy) on the validation set among the ResNet variants (ResNet18/50/101). In contrast, ResNet50 exhibited overfitting due to limited data volume (accuracy dropped to 93.76%), and ResNet101 could not be tested under the hardware constraints (e.g., GPU memory limitations) of this project.

Therefore, considering practical factors such as training time and hardware resources (CPU: Intel i5-12500H; GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop), ResNet18 was ultimately selected. It demonstrated superior efficiency, with an average training time of 30 minutes, significantly shorter than ResNet50’s 84-minute average.
#### Comparison with Other Architectures
Beyond the ResNet family, we evaluated AlexNet and GoogleNet. AlexNet, a simpler architecture with five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers (~60 million parameters; ResNet18 has ~18 million parameters), lacks residual connections. This critical limitation leads to training instability due to gradient vanishing in deeper layers. Empirical evidence indicates that AlexNet typically underperforms ResNet18 by 8–12% in validation accuracy under comparable data conditions[11].

GoogleNet, characterized by its Inception modules for multi-scale feature fusion and parallel convolutional kernels to enhance feature diversity, has approximately 7 million parameters. However, the inherent complexity of its modular architecture complicates hyperparameter tuning. While its accuracy is comparable to ResNet18 in practice, its training duration is notably longer.


【Table1-Theoretical Comparison of Common Image Recognition Models】

| Model     | Parameters | Recommended Dataset Size | Theoretical Accuracy | Training Speed（imgs/sec） |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| AlexNet   | 61M        | <10k                     | 82–85%               | 1200                     |
| GoogLeNet | 7M         | 10k–50k                  | 87–90%               | 850                      |
| ResNet18  | 11.7M      | 50k–200k                 | 92–95%               | 950                      |
| ResNet50  | 25.6M      | >200k                    | 95–97%               | 420                      |
#### Hyperparameter Configuration and Model Optimization
Regarding the hyperparameter selection for the chosen model, ​​domain discrepancy minimization​​ and ​​computational efficiency​​ were prioritized. Given the relatively small domain gap between the cat/dog classification task and the ImageNet dataset, coupled with the increased training time and GPU memory demands associated with unfreezing deep-layer parameters (which expand model capacity), this project retained ResNet18’s pre-trained convolutional layers. These layers, initialized with ImageNet weights, capture universal visual features (e.g., edges, textures, object shapes) and leverage the transfer learning capability to accelerate convergence while mitigating overfitting risks on our small-scale dataset.

For the optimizer configuration, ​​Adam optimizer​​ was selected over SGD due to its empirically faster convergence properties. During fine-tuning, only the replaced fully connected layer was trained, with the learning rate fixed at the Adam default (`lr=0.001`). Advanced regularization techniques such as Dropout or L1​/L2​ normalization, though theoretically beneficial, were not explicitly implemented in this phase to prioritize simplicity and reproducibility.
#### Rationale for Final Model Selection

The decision to adopt ResNet18 was driven by a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors:

- Task-Specific Adaptability: The residual architecture balances model depth and parameter efficiency, enabling robust feature extraction for species-discriminative traits (e.g., ear contours, fur patterns) without excessive complexity.
- Empirical Performance: Experimental validation confirmed ResNet18’s superiority in accuracy (98% validation) over deeper variants (ResNet50/101) under hardware constraints (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU).
- Training Efficiency: With a 30-minute average training cycle, ResNet18 significantly outperformed ResNet50 (84 minutes) in resource utilization, aligning with project timelines.
- Transfer Learning Synergy: Pre-trained weights provided a strong initialization baseline, reducing dependency on large-scale annotated data while enhancing generalization.

This systematic approach ensured alignment with the project’s core objectives: achieving high classification accuracy within limited computational resources while maintaining interpretability for biomedical applications.
###  Data Preprocessing Methods
The current model implements fundamental data preprocessing exclusively for the training and validation sets:
1. Image resizing: To comply with the input specifications of the ResNet architecture, all images are resized to 224×224 pixels.
2. Basic data augmentation: Random horizontal flipping is applied to enhance training set diversity and expand the effective dataset size.

Given the satisfactory performance metrics of the current model, advanced preprocessing techniques such as ​​color jittering​​ (to address illumination variations), ​​rotation​​, or ​​random cropping​​ have not been adopted in this phase[12].

However, in scenarios involving real-world testing data with significant heterogeneity (e.g., indoor/outdoor lighting disparities), integrating ​​color jittering​​ into the training pipeline could improve model generalizability by simulating diverse illumination conditions. Similarly, ​​rotation​​ and ​​cropping​​ augmentations may further align training data variability with practical use cases.

Notably, additional preprocessing methodologies discussed in the course curriculum (e.g., normalization beyond default PyTorch implementations, spatial transformations, or frequency-domain filtering) remain unexplored in this project. Future iterations could evaluate their utility in addressing domain shift or enhancing feature robustness.
## The CIFAR-10 Multi-Class Image Classification
### CIFAR-10 dataset Introduction
CIFAR-10 is a widely utilized color image dataset in the fields of machine learning and deep learning[7]. It was initially curated by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and created by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. The dataset comprises 60,000 RGB images with a spatial resolution of 32×32 pixels, categorized into 10 distinct classes (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck). Among these, 50,000 images are designated for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image contains three color channels (RGB), resulting in a shape of 32×32×3. Although the image size is relatively small, the dataset is characterized by its diversity and class balance, making it well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and the benchmarking of deep learning models.

The core pipeline of the original cat-vs-dog classification code follows the sequence: loading a pre-trained ResNet-18 model → modifying the final output layer → preparing datasets and DataLoaders → defining loss function and optimizer → performing training and validation → (optionally) conducting inference and exporting results.  
To adapt this workflow for CIFAR-10, it is sufficient to retain the original structure while modifying the dataset and DataLoader components, as well as adjusting the output layer of the model to match the 10-class configuration of CIFAR-10.

### Key Modifications
First, the model’s final fully connected layer is reconfigured for 10-class classification (instead of the original 2-class cat-vs-dog task):`model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)`
This modification ensures compatibility with the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Second, it is important to note that ResNet-18 was pre-trained on ImageNet, which contains 1000 categories, and its default input image size is typically $[224 \times 224]$. Therefore, CIFAR-10 images, which are $[32 \times 32]$ in size, are usually resized to $[224 \times 224]$ via `Resize(224, 224)` in order to match the input dimensional requirements of ResNet-18[12].

Furthermore, considering the relatively larger scale of the CIFAR-10 dataset, the data preprocessing pipeline includes standard normalization using the mean and standard deviation recommended by the official ImageNet preprocessing scheme, in order to facilitate faster and more stable model convergence.

```
transform_train = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465], std=[0.2470, 0.2435, 0.2616])

])

transform_val = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465], std=[0.2470, 0.2435, 0.2616])
])
```
Then, in consideration of the file structure of the CIFAR-10 dataset, we restructured the way training and testing datasets are loaded. Unlike the cat-vs-dog classification task which directly reads data from local directories, here we use the official dataset class `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10`, which automatically unpacks, loads, and separates the CIFAR-10 binary batch files into:
- a training set containing $[50{,}000]$ images
- a testing set containing $[10{,}000]$ images
This approach simplifies the data preparation pipeline while ensuring compatibility with PyTorch's built-in tools.

```
train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(
    root='./CIFAR-data',
    train=True,
    download=True,
    transform=transform_train
    )
    
val_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(
    root='./CIFAR-data',
    train=False,
    download=True,
    transform=transform_val
    )
```
Again, considering that the CIFAR-10 training and testing sets contain a total of $[50{,}000]$ images, we adopt a multi-threaded data loading strategy (specifically, using two worker threads) during the data loading phase to accelerate training: 
```
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
val_loader   = DataLoader(val_dataset,   batch_size=32, shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
```
The loss function and optimizer remain consistent with the cat-vs-dog classification task, still using:
- $[\text{Adam}(\text{model.parameters()},\ \text{lr}=0.001)]$
- $[\text{CrossEntropyLoss()}]$
The training and validation procedures remain unchanged.
### Reporting Classification Results
Based on the modifications described above, the final algorithm achieved the following performance on the CIFAR-10 test set:
```

## Class Imbalance Problem
In industrial applications or real-world projects, when the amount of labeled data for certain classes is significantly smaller than that of others—resulting in an imbalanced training dataset—various strategies can be adopted to address this issue. Below, I explain and justify two commonly used approaches[13]:
- Oversampling;
- Class Weighting;

### Oversampling
This technique is based on the core idea of duplicating samples from minority classes within the dataset until their quantity becomes comparable to that of majority classes. It is straightforward to implement and produces immediate and intuitive effects by exposing the model to a greater number of minority class instances, thereby mitigating its bias toward the majority class.

However, oversampling may lead to overfitting, as it does not introduce new information; the duplicated minority samples are highly similar, and the model may memorize these repeated instances rather than learning to generalize effectively.

This approach is particularly suitable in scenarios where the overall dataset size is moderate and the quality of minority class samples is relatively high. In such cases, random oversampling can quickly enhance the model’s sensitivity to underrepresented classes within a short training period.

First, we begin by importing the sampler.
```
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, WeightedRandomSampler
```
Next, compute class weights and create the sampler:
```
targets = torch.tensor(train_dataset.targets)

class_counts = torch.bincount(targets)

class_weights = 1. / class_counts.float()  

sample_weights = class_weights[targets]

sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(
    weights=sample_weights,
    num_samples=len(sample_weights),  
    replacement=True  
)
```
To address class imbalance, a sampling strategy was implemented by first calculating the inverse class frequency weights (i.e., `1/\text{class_counts}`), allowing classes with fewer samples to have a higher probability of being selected. The `WeightedRandomSampler` was used to perform sampling according to these weights, thereby balancing the data distribution. Additionally, the sampler was configured with `replacement=True` to enable repeated sampling, ensuring that minority classes are adequately represented during training.

In terms of data pipeline adjustments, the training `DataLoader` was set to use this custom sampler, with the default `shuffle` behavior explicitly disabled. Meanwhile, the validation set maintained the original sequential loading approach to reflect the true data distribution without introducing sampling bias.

It is also important to note that applying oversampling techniques on small datasets can easily lead to overfitting. To prevent this from negatively affecting prediction accuracy, we introduced several additional strategies.

First, a dynamic sampling strategy was implemented to determine whether the loaded image dataset exhibits class imbalance (with imbalance defined as a class count difference exceeding 20%)：
```
targets = torch.tensor(train_dataset.targets)
class_counts = torch.bincount(targets)
max_count, min_count = torch.max(class_counts), torch.min(class_counts)

is_imbalanced = (max_count - min_count) / max_count > 0.2

if is_imbalanced:
    print("Imbalanced data detected; oversampling strategy activated.")
    class_weights = 1. / class_counts.float()
    sample_weights = class_weights[targets]
    sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(
        sample_weights,
        num_samples=int(len(targets)*0.8),  
        replacement=(max_count/min_count > 2)  
    )

else:
    print("Data distribution is balanced; standard random sampling is used.")
    sampler = torch.utils.data.RandomSampler(
        train_dataset,
        replacement=False,
        num_samples=len(train_dataset)
    )
```
The output result was: `"Data distribution is balanced; standard random sampling is used."  `
This suggests that the CIFAR-10 dataset provided in the assignment is in fact relatively balanced. Therefore, applying random oversampling directly would introduce unnecessary redundant samples and disrupt the inherent class distribution of standardized datasets such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. This, in turn, may increase the risk of overfitting and lead to unstable prediction performance.

Results:
Compared to the baseline model without modifications, our adjusted model achieved an improvement in test set accuracy, increasing from 90.87% to 92.58%.

Final best model saved (Val Acc: 0.9258)
```

### Class Weighting
Similarly, when addressing class imbalance, class weighting is a commonly used, simple, yet effective strategy. The core idea is to assign different weights to different classes during the computation of the loss function (typically cross-entropy), based on the class distribution. This allows samples from minority classes to contribute more significantly to the overall loss, thereby encouraging the model to improve its recognition performance on underrepresented categories.

Accordingly, we incorporate code to compute class weights during the loading phase of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
```
targets = torch.tensor(train_dataset.targets)

class_counts = torch.bincount(targets)

class_weights = 1. / class_counts.float()  

class_weights = class_weights / class_weights.sum() * len(class_counts)

class_weights = class_weights.to(device)
```
Meanwhile, class weights are applied within the loss function: 
```
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)  
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```
With the increase in training epochs, the model gradually improves its ability to recognize relatively underrepresented classes.

Results:  
Compared to the baseline model without modifications, our adjusted model achieved an improvement in test set accuracy, increasing from 90.87% to 91.61%.
